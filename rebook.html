    <p>Reebok International Limited (/ˈriːbɒk/) is a footwear and clothing manufacturer owned by German sporting goods giant Adidas.[4][5][6][7] Reebok produces and distributes fitness, running, and CrossFit sportswear, including clothing and footwear. It is the former official footwear and apparel sponsor for CrossFit and current sponsor for Spartan Race.[8]

In 1958, Reebok was established in Great Britain as a companion company to J.W. Foster and Sons, a sporting goods company which had been founded in 1895 in Bolton, Lancashire. From 1958 until 1986, the brand featured the Union Jack in its logo to signify the origins of the company.

The company's global headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., with regional offices in Amsterdam, Montreal, Hong Kong, and Mexico City.

In November 2016, Reebok announced it would be moving its headquarters from the Boston suburb of Canton to the innovation and design building in the seaport district of South Boston. The reasons for the move, according to the company, were to be located in an urban environment that is more desirable to millennial workers and to "clarify the roles" of United States offices.[12] The move was completed in autumn of 2018.</p>
